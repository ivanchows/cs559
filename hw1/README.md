Linear Regression

a) Implemented Linear Regression Model using Closed-form solution (normal equation) and Stochastic gradient descent on California Dataset to predict housing prices (in millions). 

b) Developed a Ridge Regression Model using Mini-batch gradient descent and K-fold crossing validation on Bike sharing dataset to predict the total rental bike counts.
